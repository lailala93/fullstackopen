0.6: New note in Single page app diagram
Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user creates a new note using the single-page version of the app.

This was the last exercise, and it's time to push your answers to GitHub and mark the exercises as done in the submission system.

I am guessing i need to continue the last exercise:

    participant server

    Note right of browser: User writes note: 'Making a new note'+ clicks save
    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    Note right of browser: Sends JSON [{"content": "Making a new note","date": "2026-01-12T14:08:37.518Z"}]

    Note over browser: Browser adds the new note to the list and re-renders (no page reload)
